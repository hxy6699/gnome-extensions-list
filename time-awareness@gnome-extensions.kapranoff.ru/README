GNOME Shell extension to tell you how long you are using your
computer. It does not have any settings or menus. After approximately
one minute you will start seeing the length of your current session in
the top GNOME Shell panel close to the date and time of day. This
number will reset and disappear after you stop using you keyboard,
mouse etc. for 2 minutes.
